# Matteo's website üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

## The journey
My journey in building my website has been an evolving process, spanning nearly four years. I initially started with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but over time, I found it to be somewhat outdated. I started blogging and wrote a few posts about software development approaches, TDD and other stuff but I grew tired of it, probably because I did not found it very interesting. Those posts are now gone üóëÔ∏è

And so I did not take care of my website for a while.

After some time, I thought I could use it to showcase projects and applications that I worked on, which I hope it will be useful when applying for a job.

## Eleventy

I wanted something more modern, so I explored other static site generators, testing both [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). Hugo seemed very powerful, but I could not find a template to use as a starting point, so I hesitated to commit. Eleventy, on the other hand, offers a simple and neat template for a blog: [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog), which suited my needs perfectly. After getting to know Eleventy more and more, it seems like it offers flexibility, simplicity, and, most importantly, the ability to work with web-native technologies. Moreover, you can use all the packages that you can find on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and that made my decision easy: Eleventy was the perfect fit.

Working with Eleventy has been an enjoyable experience. It feels intuitive, lightweight, and adaptable. When it came to design, I initially looked into neo-brutalism, thanks to [Isabella Muerte's web site](https://izzys.casa/), which I think is <mark>sooo cool!</mark> However I found neo-brutalism vibrant colors a bit overwhelming. Instead, I blended inspiration from [GitHub's Primer](https://primer.style/) and [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) palettes, carefully selecting colors that felt balanced and easy on the eyes while still maintaining a bold and unique character.

I have made both a dark and light theme, for now. I was wondering whether it's worth the effort. I might remove one theme if it's too much work.

Though I‚Äôve only scratched the surface of what Eleventy can do, I already appreciate its speed, flexibility, and how seamlessly it fits into my workflow. This project has not only helped me build a website that truly feels like mine but has also left me excited to explore Eleventy‚Äôs full potential in the future.
