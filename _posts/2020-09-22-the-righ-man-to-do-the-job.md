HallÃ¸j! ðŸ‘‹

In today's post, I'd like to talk about a way of saying which, I think, discloses a mindset that doesn't go hand-in-hand with *Agile*.
The sentence is the following:

> ## The right man for the job.

Let's go straight to the point:

There shouldn't be any *man* who's *"right"* for the job.

Following Agile and being in a Scrum team, one could rather say: the right *team* for the job. 
On the other hand, *the job* should be rather *refined* by the team and, whenever it's ready and understood, put into the iteration.

That's it.

If anyone approaches a developer, during the iteration, asking:
> "Can you work on this task now? we need it asap."

or

> "Marketing requested us to deliver some new screenshots for the application by Wednesday. We have one day. Can you do it asap?"

Let's assume that the application's screenshots are generated automatically by a pipeline, however it needs to be extended quite a lot. And you are considered the *expert* for screenshots generation (that's why you have been asked).

Would you really do it asap? Well, if it were me, yes I would...

...for the sake of getting the job done!

but then I think there is a big, big problem in the team and the way we work, or maybe I misunderstood it. Assuming that we follow *Agile*, then I think I should have rather said:

> "Bob, I'm sorry. I can't do it asap. Put the task in tomorrow's refinement, so the team will refine it and know what needs to be done. Then we'll take it into the next iteration and do it straight away.

That's how I think these kind of situations should be handled. Knowledge will be shared among the team members, and next time, there won't be any *right man for the job.*

till next time.. 

Hygge!
