Halløj! 👋

I'm Matteo and I'm a software developer.
Even though I've found it out a little late, Programming is my passion ❤️! What I like the most about it, is that you are learning constantly.

Here are a few projects I’ve worked on:

<ul class="projects">
    <li>
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oticon-on/id980191174">
            <img src="../assets/images/oticon/oticon-on-app-icon.png" alt="Oticon ON"/>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/yousee-tv-film/id476306715">
            <img src="../assets/images/yousee/yousee-app-icon.png" alt="YouSee TV & Film"/>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://digitalaudio.dk/dadman/">
            <img src="../assets/images/ntp/dadman-icon.png" alt="DADman"/>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

Currently I'm working as a Software Developer at [NTP Technology A/S](https://ntp.dk/) & [Digital Audio Denmark](https://digitalaudio.dk) on the [DADman](https://digitalaudio.dk/dadman/) software.

Hygge!
