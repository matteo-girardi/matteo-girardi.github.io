Hall√∏j! üëã

My name is Matteo and I'm a software developer. Programming is my passion ‚ù§Ô∏è! What I like the most about it is that you are constantly learning new things every single day.

Here you can find a list of projects that I‚Äôve worked on:

<ul class="projects">

        </a>

            <img src="../assets/images/ntp/dadman-icon.png" alt="DADman"/>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

Currently I'm working at [NTP Technology A/S](https://ntp.dk/) (aka [Digital Audio Denmark](https://digitalaudio.dk)) on the [DADman](https://digitalaudio.dk/dadman/) application.

Hygge!
