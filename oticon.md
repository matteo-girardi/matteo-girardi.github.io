At Oticon I have been part of the iOS team in Copenhagen. The other part of the team was located in Warsaw, Poland. One or twice a year, I travelled there to work closely together and strenghten our collaboration. This app was white-labelled for several brands app: Bernafon, Sonic and Philips.

My responsibilities and tasks were the following:

- UI development using UIKit

- Developing REST APIs with back-end teams

Features & projects I have worked on:

- Brand new UI supporting white-labelling.
  Other apps (Bernafon, Sonic & Philips) were developed based on the Oticon ON app.
- Localization of several languages
- MyHearingDay feature: Recording audio data throughout the day and the showing it to the user.
- Support new models of hearing aids: decoding new features and capabilities of the hearing aid throught Bluetooth.

For a period of time, around six months, I have fulfilled the **Scrum Master** role of my team.

Languages, Tools and Technologies:

- Swift/Objective-C, Ruby, Bash.
